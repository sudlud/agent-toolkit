# Ticket Fetcher

**Fetch only** — no analysis, requirements, or planning. Output is a self-contained `.TICKET.md`.

## Source & access

Identify the tracker from the input (URL host, or id shape) and fetch through the matching MCP
server — e.g. **Azure DevOps MCP** for ADO work items, **Atlassian MCP** for Jira issues, **GitHub
MCP / `gh`** for GitHub issues. Use whichever equivalent tools are connected; tool name prefixes
vary by config. Resolve once any handle the MCP needs (e.g. Atlassian `cloudId`, ADO project) and
reuse it. If the input is ambiguous, or no matching MCP is connected, ask the user / stop — don't
guess.

## Your task

1. **Resolve the input.** Accept a full ticket URL or a bare id/key; extract the identifier. If the
   tracker uses a key prefix (e.g. `XX-1234`), keep it; otherwise use the bare number. If the input
   is unrecognizable, ask.
2. **Fetch the ticket.** Get the work item/issue with its full field set, comments inline, and
   related links/relations expanded. Capture **everything** the ticket carries — don't pre-filter to
   a fixed set of fields. Convert whatever rich-text form you get (HTML, ADF, …) to clean Markdown.
3. **Pick a slug.** Short kebab-case slug, 3–5 words, from the title/summary — greppable, don't
   overthink it.
4. **Decide the output directory.** A project-relative `<id>-<slug>/` subdirectory inside the
   project's **planning directory** (e.g. `.claude/plans/`) — follow the project's/user's convention
   for where plans live; if none is defined, ask the user. Never guess. If it already exists,
   suggest `<id>-<slug>-v2`, `-v3`, etc. — **never overwrite** an existing plan directory; history
   per re-fetch is kept on purpose.
5. **Write the ticket file** at `<output-dir>/<id>-<slug>.TICKET.md`.
6. **Download attachments** into the output directory; warn on any that fail (see Attachments).
7. **Print the result** — project-relative paths and the next-step line (see Next step).

## Ticket file structure

Must stand on its own: a complete, readable version of the ticket with enough metadata that a fresh
session can identify the source without re-fetching.

### Header

Plain markdown header with source metadata; omit any line whose value is absent. Include whatever
the tracker provides. Example:

```markdown
# <title / summary>

> **Source** [<id>](<url>)
> **Type** {type}
> **Status** {status}
> **Assignee** {display name or "—"}
> **Reporter / Created by** {display name}
> **Labels / Tags** {joined or "—"}
> **Fetched** {today YYYY-MM-DD}
```

### Body sections

Emit in this order, **only if present and non-empty**:

1. `## Description`
2. `## Acceptance criteria` — if the tracker has a dedicated AC field populated
3. `## <Other fields>` — one section per other populated field carrying real content (technical
   notes, custom fields, …), headed by the field's display name. Capture everything the ticket
   holds.
4. `## Comments` — oldest first, each `### <author> — <date>` then the body. Best-effort: if
   comments aren't returned, note it briefly or omit the section.
5. `## Related tickets` — see below
6. `## Attachments` — see below
7. `## Design references` — see below

Preserve heading hierarchy, bullet structure, emphasis, and code blocks; map in-field subheadings to
`####`. Omit empty sections. Quote user-facing strings, code identifiers, file paths, i18n keys, and
URLs **verbatim** — never alter or translate them.

### Related tickets

From the response's links/relations (and any remote-link tool), for each unique linked ticket
(excluding this one) fetch **only** title + status + type via a cheap call — **not** the full body.
The main goal is that there is a trace of all related tickets, so they can be fetched later if
needed. One bullet each, with the relationship if available:

```markdown
- [<id>](<url>) — (<type>, <status>) <title>
```

For non-ticket remote links (e.g. a wiki/Confluence page), emit the title and URL as a plain bullet.
If a fetch fails, list the link with `(unable to fetch)` rather than failing the whole run.

### Attachments

Identify every attachment **and** every inline image referenced in the description/fields, numbered
`attachment-<N>.<ext>` in order of first appearance, keeping the original extension. `<N>` runs
across both combined.

**Always try to fetch — across every connected MCP.** Beyond tracker-hosted attachments, the ticket
may link external assets (e.g. a Confluence/ADO resource — for design-tool links such as Figma or
Zeplin see Design references below) reachable through their own MCP, including spec/doc files in a
linked git repo (fetch their content via git or the repo MCP, save into the output dir under their
own filename). Use whichever MCP fits the source to pull them down; don't pre-declare a link
unfetchable. If a fitting MCP is connected but
**not authenticated**, don't silently skip — proactively run its auth flow (surface the login URL,
complete the handshake) without waiting to be asked, then fetch. When it's unclear whether an asset
can or should be downloaded, ask the user.

Download each **straight to disk** — `curl -fSL <url> -o attachment-<N>.<ext>`, or the MCP
attachment tool's save-to-path variant. **Never** route an attachment as inline base64 through the
model and re-emit it: output caps (~100k chars) truncate it silently — valid header, missing
trailer, won't open. Some attachment MCP tools return **only** base64 with no save-to-path option
(e.g. ADO `wit_get_work_item_attachment`) — don't use them for binaries; fetch from the tracker's
REST API straight to disk with a bearer token instead (ADO: `az account get-access-token --resource
499b84ac-1321-427f-aa17-267ca6975798 --query accessToken -o tsv`, then `curl -H "Authorization:
Bearer <token>" "<attachmentUrl>" -o attachment-<N>.<ext>`). (Content URLs often share the MCP's
auth; on 401, retry with the tracker's bearer token if obtainable.)

**Verify integrity, not just transfer** — non-empty; matches `Content-Length` if sent; type trailer
present (PNG `IEND`, JPEG `FFD9`, PDF `%%EOF`). A size that's an exact multiple of 3 near a round
character boundary signals base64 truncation. On failure, re-download to disk; if still bad, treat
as **not downloaded** and warn — never reference a corrupt file. Then, per file:

- **Downloaded** → reference the local file.
- **Not downloaded** (no fitting MCP/attachment tool, auth that couldn't be completed, etc.) →
  still reference the local file and the source URL, and add it to the list to warn about. Don't
  block — the ticket is usable either way.

Image → embed; non-image (PDF, .docx, …) → link instead:

```markdown
### Attachment 1

![attachment-1](attachment-1.png)
_Original filename: image.png_

### Attachment 2

[attachment-2.pdf](attachment-2.pdf) — _Original filename: design-spec.pdf_
```

For a file that couldn't be downloaded, append its source so the user can fetch it manually: `— not
downloaded; get it from <url> and save here as attachment-<N>.<ext>`.

### Design references

For design-tool links (Figma, Zeplin, Sketch, Adobe XD, …) in the description/comments, don't number
them as `attachment-<N>` — they're living references, not attached files. Capture each referenced
frame/screen via that tool's MCP (e.g. Figma MCP `get_screenshot`), downloading the returned
short-lived URL straight to disk as `<tool>-<id>-<slug>.png` (auth its MCP first if needed — see
Attachments). If no MCP for that tool is connected, still record the entry with its name and source
URL and add it to the warn list — same as an undownloaded attachment. Record one entry per link,
with the local preview plus the identifiers needed to re-open it in that tool:

```markdown
### <design name>

![figma-<nodeId>](figma-<nodeId>-<slug>.png)
_Figma · file `<fileKey>` · node `<nodeId>` · [source](<url>)_
```

## Boundaries

- **Do not** analyze, plan, or explore the codebase for context — this does not exempt files the
  ticket explicitly links, which you still fetch (see Attachments).
- **Do not** modify the ticket in its tracker — fetching is **read-only** (no comments, transitions,
  edits, worklogs).
- The only files you create: the `.TICKET.md`, its attachments, and any linked docs you fetched.

## Next step

State clearly when done, using **project-relative paths** (never absolute): the output directory,
the ticket file, and any attachments. If any attachment could not be downloaded, **first emit a
clear warning** listing each missing `attachment-<N>.<ext>` and its source URL, instructing the user
to download it and save it under that exact name so the embeds resolve. Then hand off the next
phase as a **single copy-pasteable launch command** — session name and prompt combined, so one paste
starts the session. Use the launch syntax of the agent tool in use (vendor-agnostic — `claude` below
is only the example), naming the session `refine-<slug>`:

```
claude --name refine-<slug> "/refine-ticket <output-dir>/<id>-<slug>.TICKET.md"
```
