# Compact skill creator

Author a new skill, or improve an existing one, so it carries **all** its rules and intent in
the **least text possible**. Skills load into the agent's context, so every wasted word is a standing
cost. Be interactive: gather what you need, draft, then apply only on approval.

## Core principle

Write each piece of information with the least text that still preserves every rule, constraint, edge
case, and intent. Two directions, equally binding:

- Cut duplication, filler, and anything restatable more briefly.
- **Never** drop text whose removal loses information or instruction, just to be shorter.

Recurring reflex: *"Can this exact rule be said in fewer words?"* — if yes, do it.

## Trigger taxonomy — classify first

How a skill is triggered decides how its `description` is written. Classify into one:

- **Mandatory** — must auto-load *whenever* a task type is touched (e.g. "working on UI components",
  "dealing with unit tests"). A silent miss defeats its purpose, so the description **spends words** on a
  strict, concrete trigger: concrete verbs + the artifact ("when creating, editing, or reviewing …").
- **Manual** — invoked deliberately (e.g. a `/command`). No trigger bait; the description just states
  what it does so a human choosing from a list understands it.
- **Self-Evident** — auto-loadable, but intent is obvious from a natural request (e.g. "fetch a ticket").
  Trigger words ≈ the task name, so a short description routes correctly without a when/when-not clause.

Governing rule: **description tokens are justified only by trigger precision, never by summary.**
Compress *within* a type — but never starve a Mandatory trigger to save a few tokens.

## Agnosticism

- **Agent-agnostic — hard rule.** Say "the agent" / "the session"; never vendor names ("Claude Code",
  "Claude", etc.). When improving a skill, flag and fix violations.
- **Project-agnostic — best-effort.** Default to generic wording. Couple to a project/framework/tool only
  when the skill's purpose requires it; when you must, keep it explicit and contained — declared up front
  or in a referenced doc.

## Progressive disclosure — when to split

A skill folder can hold a lean `SKILL.md` that references supporting `.md` docs. A referenced doc loads
**only when the agent follows the pointer** — that is the lever.

- **Primary criterion: conditional relevance.** Extract content needed only in a sub-case (rare branch,
  long reference table, worked example, framework-specific detail). Keep always-needed instructions inline.
- **Size only modulates:** large conditional chunks are strong candidates; tiny ones stay inline (a
  pointer plus a round-trip can cost more than it saves). These are signals, not hard limits.
- Test: *"Needed on every invocation, or only in a sub-case — and big enough that inlining taxes every
  invocation? If both, extract it."*

## Workflow

1. **Detect mode.** A path/skill argument → improve; none → create. To create, put the skill in its own
   folder alongside existing skills, following the project's convention — ask the user if it's unclear;
   folder name and `name` field must match, in kebab-case.
2. **Intake — interview to shared understanding.** Before drafting, ask about anything you can't safely
   infer — at minimum the purpose, **trigger type**, and any unavoidable coupling. Favor asking over
   guessing: one question at a time, each with a recommended answer. Scale depth to complexity (complex
   skill → more questions; simple → few). The only limit: never interview for its own sake.
3. **Metadata.** Always include the frontmatter fields; never hardcode their values. Creating: infer
   defaults from context (sibling `SKILL.md` files, `git config user.name`, repo `LICENSE`), ask the
   user to confirm or override, and start version at `"1.0"`. Improving: preserve existing fields, and
   ask the user whether to bump the version or add any missing field.
4. **Draft** (create) or **improve** (existing). Improving cuts redundancy *and* adds or clarifies where
   the skill is vague, under-specified, or missing a rule — loop back to intake for more questions if
   gaps surface.
5. **Self-review** before presenting (terse yes/no checks):
   - Every original rule/intent still present?
   - Wording agent-agnostic? Project coupling contained?
   - Trigger type identified, and the description written to fit it? Then test the description: reading
     only it, would an agent open the skill for the intended task (must be yes) and skip it for a
     similar but unrelated task (must be no)? Reword until both hold.
   - Duplication/filler gone?
   - When removing text: list each removed item and confirm it is filler/duplication, not intent.
6. **Present** before→after with a token/word delta (for improve mode); apply only on approval.
