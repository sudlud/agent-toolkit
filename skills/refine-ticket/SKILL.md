# Refine ticket

The **Refine** phase of Refine → Plan → Act: turn a raw ticket into a validated requirements
document a fresh session can plan from. Analysis only — it defines **what** must be true when the
work is done, never **how** to build it, and never touches code.

## What, not how — but verified against the code

You cannot define the "what" in a vacuum. Every requirement must be checked against the **actual
code, config, and design** — a ticket may be stale, ambiguous, or contradicted by the codebase.
Reading the code here is for *validating* requirements, not for designing the solution.

## Golden rule: never guess — ask

- Anything determinable by reading the code, resolve by reading the code — never ask the user about it.
- Anything *not* determinable from ticket + code, ask — never fill the gap with a plausible assumption.
- Treat "this probably works like X" as a question, not a fact. Keep "I confirmed X", "the ticket
  claims X", and "I assume X" distinct; the latter two never become the first without evidence.
- Before declaring something missing, broaden the search — "not found under the name the ticket used"
  is not "not present".
- Verify both sides of an integration: if a requirement relies on another layer behaving a certain
  way, open that layer and confirm it.

## Grill to resolve every branch

After gathering and code-verifying, run a grilling interview to close every remaining decision:

- One question at a time, each with your recommended answer.
- If a question is answerable from the codebase, answer it by exploring — don't ask.
- Walk each branch of the decision tree, resolving dependencies between decisions, until there is
  shared understanding and no open branch that blocks implementation.

Separate two kinds of uncertainty:
- **Blocking** — implementation can't proceed without it (a contradiction, a missing referenced
  file). Resolve during grilling, before writing the file.
- **Non-blocking** — a reasonable default exists but a human should confirm. Record under Open
  questions with your tentative answer.

## Output: the REQUIREMENTS file

Must stand alone for a **fresh session** with no memory of this conversation and no access to the
ticket — this is the single most important constraint. No "as discussed", "we agreed", or "see ticket".

Location:
- If the ticket input is a **local file**, write the REQUIREMENTS file in the **same directory**,
  replacing `.TICKET` with `.REQUIREMENTS` (e.g. `FOO.TICKET.md` → `FOO.REQUIREMENTS.md`); if the
  input doesn't follow that convention, append `.REQUIREMENTS` before `.md`.
- If there is **no local ticket file** (a tracker URL/ID, pasted text), use the project's planning
  convention: propose a kebab-case `<slug>` (prefix the tracker id when the ticket is bound to one),
  **confirm it with the user**, then write `<plans-dir>/<slug>/<slug>.REQUIREMENTS.md` (default
  `<plans-dir>` is `.claude/plans/`).

Five parts (Overrides and Open questions may be empty — don't pad):

1. **Context** — 1–3 sentences: the feature, what's in scope, what's out.
2. **Requirements** — deduplicated functional + technical list. Tag each item with its source
   (e.g. `(Description)`, `(AC)`, `(Codebase)`). Group by area when it aids reading. Cite the concrete
   file path / identifier inline wherever a requirement touches code; cite a reused pattern as
   `path:line-range`.
3. **Overrides** — where the ticket says one thing and the requirement says another (ticket is stale,
   wrong, or self-contradictory). Each entry: what the ticket says, what the code/AC shows, the
   resulting requirement.
4. **Open questions** — non-blocking ambiguities, each with your tentative answer and why it's
   non-blocking. Blocking questions never appear here.
5. **Acceptance criteria** — flat, verifiable checklist the implementation must satisfy.

Each requirement is self-contained; user-facing strings that must stay in a given language are quoted
verbatim.

## Boundaries

- Do **not** write an implementation plan or describe "how".
- Do **not** modify any source files. The only file you write is the REQUIREMENTS document.

When done, state — in **project-relative paths** — that the requirements file is ready, then suggest
the next steps:

```
Next: /create-manual-test-instructions <path>.REQUIREMENTS.md   # QA manual test
Then: /create-implementation-plan <path>.REQUIREMENTS.md        # Plan phase
```
