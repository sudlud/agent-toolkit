# Self-review

Make a changeset merge-ready before submission — no regressions, sound code, the project's
conventions respected — and prove it was scrutinized: a fresh-context reviewer hunts for what
would block the merge, the author answers every finding, and a compact report — scannable by a
maintainer in seconds — records the outcome. The report is the review record only; the change's
what/why belongs to the PR description (e.g. via /handover), never here.

Only for a changeset you authored. The fresh-context reviewer exists to escape authoring
blindness, so someone else's PR has nothing to escape and belongs to `maintainer-review`.

## Pin the changeset

1. Resolve source and target. No input → current branch against the auto-detected target: the
   default branch of the `upstream` remote when one exists (fork workflow), else of `origin` —
   via `git ls-remote --symref <remote> HEAD`, never the often-absent local
   `refs/remotes/<remote>/HEAD`; that failing (e.g. offline), the sole existing candidate among
   `main`, `master`, `develop`/`development` (preferring `upstream`'s remote-tracking ref, then
   `origin`'s, then the local branch) — still ambiguous or none → ask. Explicit branches in the
   invocation win; a detached HEAD → ask which branch is under review. State the chosen target.
2. Modified tracked files block the run — the diff covers commits only, so uncommitted work
   would ship unreviewed under a clean report. What belongs to the change the author commits;
   what doesn't, they stash — or confirm as deliberate local-only tweaks (build config, data
   paths): the run proceeds, a report caveat naming those files. Untracked files don't block,
   but list them and have the author confirm none belong to the change — a forgotten `git add`
   ships unreviewed later; any that do belong, the author commits before proceeding. Only the
   report this skill writes is exempt from both checks.
3. `git fetch` the target's remote (local-only target → nothing to fetch; a failed fetch → say
   so and ask rather than diff stale refs), then diff `<target>...<source>` (merge-base three-dot).
   No merge base → usually a shallow clone or wrong target: deepen (`git fetch --unshallow`)
   and retry, else ask — never fall back to a two-dot diff, which presents the target's own
   commits as the author's. Empty diff → probably a wrong target (typical: a fork's default
   branch already holding the commits) — say so and ask for the true one; it needs no local
   ref, `git fetch <url> <branch>` works by URL.

Done when source branch, target, and reviewed SHA are recorded and the diff is non-empty.

## Project rules file

`.agents/docs/self-review-rules.md`, when the project carries one, adds project-specific rules or
overrides to the review mandate and process (extra focus areas, round cap, report handling) —
never to the Boundaries below. Absent → skip silently. Either way, the report states whether it
was found and applied.

## Review

Load and follow [fresh-eyes-review](../fresh-eyes-review/SKILL.md) on the pinned changeset —
inputs all explicit, so it runs without its confirmation step — with:

- an intent statement — one or two sentences distilled from the task's ticket or requirements
  when the planning home holds them, never the document itself (it carries the author rationale
  excluded below), else derived from the branch name and commit subjects; derivation yielding
  noise (`wip` commits, opaque names) → ask the author for a one-liner, proposing a draft.
  Either way, state the intent used — the author must see what the change is judged against;
- excluded paths: the planning home and the report — author rationale and past dispositions must
  never reach the reviewer. Planning files the changeset itself touches ship in the PR, so they
  are reviewed like any other change; the report stays excluded always;
- the mandate framed as a maintainer's merge gate — would anything here block the merge? — and
  extended by: the project's own governing docs (contributing, agent instructions, codestyle) run
  as a checklist, not as background reading, against every changed file and the submission itself,
  whose metadata the prompt must carry (commit subjects, and any PR title, description, linked
  issues); and leftovers — debug prints, commented-out code, stray TODOs, accidentally committed
  files;
- the grounded bar: a finding exists only with a nameable concrete failure, violated rule, or
  redundancy — hedged speculation is out, zero findings is a valid outcome;
- an instruction to the reviewer to report back the harness and model it ran on, and whether it
  covered every changed file — naming any it didn't.

Done when the reviewer has returned its findings — possibly none — its provenance, and its
coverage.

## Disposition walk

One finding at a time, recommending a disposition with a one-line why — the author decides, and
discussing the finding is offered as visibly as the dispositions themselves, never left an implicit
escape hatch. Anything the author says that isn't a disposition is discussion, not a decision:
answer the question, check the code, revise the recommendation, do what they ask with the finding —
then the walk returns to that same finding, still open. Three dispositions close one:

- **fix** — apply it to the working tree now; committing stays the author's move.
- **dismiss** — record the author's reason, pushing once toward one a maintainer can evaluate
  ("the caller already null-checks", not "disagree"); "mirrors the existing pattern" counts only
  once that pattern is verified sound — an unchecked one ratifies its bugs; if the author
  insists, their words go in verbatim.
- **defer** — not fixed and not dismissed but handed onward: a follow-up ticket, a comment on
  another PR, a note the author keeps. Record the destination in one line; drafting the text is
  in scope, filing or posting it is not (Boundaries).

Never drop or soften a finding: every one appears in the report with its disposition. Anything
fixed → the author commits (always their move) and a fresh round runs on the new SHA — fixes are
new unreviewed code. Rounds stop when one yields nothing fixed — clean, or every new finding
dismissed or deferred — or at the cap of 3 rounds, there to bound cost; the author can stop earlier
at any point, or explicitly ask for rounds beyond the cap. Every fix no later round covered leaves a
"fixes not re-reviewed" caveat in the report — including fixes left uncommitted, which are also
marked `fixed (uncommitted)`. Dispositions carry forward across rounds: a re-raised finding matching
a dismissed or deferred one keeps that disposition and is not re-walked; one matching a fixed
finding means the fix didn't hold — reopen it and walk it again. The report lists each finding once,
with its latest disposition.

Done when every finding is dispositioned and a stop condition has ended the rounds.

## Report

`<slug>.SELF-REVIEW.md` in the task's planning home, per the project's planning-directory
convention (e.g. `.agents/plans/<slug>/`); reuse the slug of the task's existing artifacts
(ticket, requirements, plan) — none → derive it from context (branch name, the changes); no
planning home resolvable → default to `.agents/plans/<slug>/`, stating the choice rather than
asking. Re-runs and later rounds update the file in place — read it first and carry its rounds
and dispositions forward, under the carry-forward rule — one file per task, never versioned
copies: its destination is a single upload. It is for pasting into the PR description or a
comment, not for committing, unless the project rules file says otherwise — either way committing
is the author's move, never the agent's.

Two parts — maintainers drown in AI-generated review walls, so the visible part stays minimal.
Visible, each line its own paragraph (blank lines between, no blockquote): the heading,
**Outcome**, outcome-weakening caveats, **Reviewed**, **By**, verification evidence (e.g. testing
performed). Everything else collapses into `<details>`, in order: **Intent**, **Project rules**,
procedural caveats, the rounds; the blank line after `</summary>` is required — without it the
markdown inside won't render. Placement, unless project rules explicitly override: a caveat is
visible iff it weakens what **Outcome** claims (fixes not re-reviewed, incomplete coverage naming
the unreviewed files, a same-context fallback), procedural confirmations (e.g. files confirmed
local-only) collapse; any other line is visible iff it records verification performed or
qualifies the outcome — proof-of-process collapses.

Compact above all: one line per finding, fusing location and concrete failure; the full prose
stays in the session. The **Reviewed** line always carries the latest round's SHA and diffstat;
history lives in the round headings. Provenance exactly as the environment reports it, `unknown`
when it doesn't — never guessed or recalled; the reviewer's model, when it differs from the
session's, appended to the **By** line as `review by <model>`; skill version from this file's
frontmatter, date = today.

```markdown
# Self-review — my-feature → main

**Outcome** 4 findings — 2 fixed, 1 deferred, 1 dismissed — final round clean

**Reviewed** `def5678` (`my-feature` vs `main`, merge-base diff — 12 files, +340 −120)

**By** <harness>, <model> — self-review v<version>, <date>

<details>
<summary>Review details (2 rounds)</summary>

**Intent** <the intent statement the review ran against>

**Project rules** `.agents/docs/self-review-rules.md` not present

## Round 1 — `abc1234`, 4 findings

1. `src/foo.c:142` — null deref when the timer expires mid-update → **fixed**
2. `db/updates/xyz.sql:3` — DELETE misses linked_id rows, orphans on re-run → **fixed**
3. `src/bar.c:210` — retry loop has no backoff, hammers the API during an outage → **deferred**:
   predates this change, author files it as a follow-up ticket
4. `src/foo.c:97` — guard duplicates the check 4 lines up → **dismissed**: mirrors the pattern in
   this file, checked sound at :61 and :88; refactor out of scope

## Round 2 — `def5678`, clean

</details>
```

Done when the report holds the outcome line, intent, changeset refs with diffstat, provenance
with skill version and date, rules-file status, and every round with its SHA and dispositioned
findings — each on its mandated side of the split.

## Wrap up

Print: the report's project-relative path, with the instruction to paste its content into the PR
description or a comment; a warning not to commit the report — a later `git add .` drags it into
the PR — unless the project rules file says otherwise; a reminder to run the project's usual
checks (build, lint, tests) before pushing — this skill never runs them; and that any commit
after the review needs a re-run, so the reported SHA matches the pushed head. Done when all four
are printed.

## Boundaries

- Files written: the report, and the fixes the author approved during the walk — nothing else.
- Read-only git plus `git fetch`; no commit, push, or PR operation — publishing is the author's.
