Symlink every rule from this repo into agent config directories, in two
layers:

  1. the agent-neutral dir (default: ~/.agents/rules) gets one link per
     rule file, pointing into this repo;
  2. the agent's own rules dir (default: ~/.claude/rules) gets links
     pointing at the corresponding agent-neutral entries.

The rules are the toolkit's opinionated layer — always-on behavior
policies. Skills never depend on them; installing rules is a deliberate
opt-in, which is why this lives apart from ./install.sh (skills).

Each rule (rules/*.md) is linked individually, so you can also link just
the ones you want by hand instead of running this.

Re-running converges: correct links are left alone, links owned by this
repo that point elsewhere (e.g. the old direct layout) are re-pointed, and
broken links owned by this repo are pruned. To wire up another agent, run
again with its --rules-dir.
