Read-only git is always fine: `status`, `diff`, `log`, `show`, `blame`, etc.

Anything that modifies history, refs, the working tree, or a remote needs an EXPLICIT instruction
from the user, in the conversation, for that specific action. A step in a plan or other doc doesn't
count: even under "execute the plan", stop at that step and ask. Don't put such steps in plans on
your own. This covers: commit, amend, branch, tag, stash; `push`/`pull`/`fetch --prune`,
`merge`, `rebase`, `cherry-pick`; any `reset`/`restore`/`checkout` that discards changes; `clean`;
force variants (`--force`, `--force-with-lease`); submodule, worktree, and config writes.

Never run history-rewriting or discarding commands without an instruction naming that command (e.g.
`reset --hard`, `clean -fd`, `push --force*`).

Assume other sessions may be changing the repo concurrently; don't rely on the working tree or index
being as you last saw it.
