# agent-toolkit

My own toolkit for AI Agentic Coding — a collection of reusable, project-agnostic tools that I use
across multiple projects.

- **Rules** — generic behavioral rules I apply at user level across all projects. Each file in
  [`rules/`](rules) is a single, self-contained rule.
- **Skills** — skills I reuse across projects. Each lives in its own directory under
  [`skills/`](skills) with a `SKILL.md` describing its trigger, allowed tools, and steps.

## Install via symlinks

[`install.sh`](install.sh) symlinks every rule and skill from this repo into your user's config.

This means the skills and rules will automatically be available in all your projects without
copying files around.

By default rules go to `~/.claude/rules` and skills to `~/.claude/skills`, but you can easily
override this.

First clone the repo (or your own fork):

```sh
git clone git@github.com:FrancescoBorzi/agent-toolkit.git && cd agent-toolkit
```

Then you can run:

```sh
./install.sh
```

This will link all rules and all skills. To customize, use the options below:

```sh
./install.sh --rules-only            # link rules only
./install.sh --skills-only           # link skills only
./install.sh --skills-dir DIR        # custom skills destination (e.g. a project's .claude/skills)
./install.sh --rules-dir DIR         # custom rules destination
./install.sh --force                 # overwrite existing files/symlinks
./install.sh --help
```

Each rule and skill is linked individually.

You can also skip the script and symlink just the ones you want by hand:

```sh
ln -s "$(pwd)/rules/no-nonsense-comments.md" ~/.claude/rules/
ln -s "$(pwd)/skills/run-nx-checks"          ~/.claude/skills/
```

Start a new session and run `/context` to confirm everything is loaded. Rules and skills apply at
the user level (all projects); to scope them to one project, symlink into that repo's
`.claude/rules/` or `.claude/skills/` instead.

## Install skills via skills.sh

You can also use the [skills.sh](https://skills.sh/) installer to install the skills from this repo:

```sh
npx skills add FrancescoBorzi/agent-toolkit
```
